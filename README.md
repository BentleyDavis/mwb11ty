# Errors that need fixing

- `Example Page` on `Get Started with Massive Wiki` doesn't show brackets and makes a link
- `All Pages` does not work
- `Home` is `readme` but should be `index.html`
- Should these all be `.html` instead of `/`
- passtrhough markdown from output and other ignored files are copied. maybe write my own passthrough?
