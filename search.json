The Obsidian user community is great, as is Eleanor Konik's [Obsidian Roundup](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tag/roundup/). (Pulsar Edit is a good choice, too.)\r\n- Use HackMD or HedgeDoc to work synchronously with people. You can save notes as Markdown files, and add them straight to your wikis.\r\n- Read some of the original wiki culture writeups. You can get a start here: [Link As You Think](https://developer.massive.wiki/wiki_theory_and_culture/link_as_you_think), which links to [The Brilliant Essence of Wikis](https://eekim.com/2005/09/the-brilliant-essence-of-wikis/) by Eugene Eric Kim, and to [WikiNow](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WikiNow) on MeatballWiki.

Wiki was first developed by Ward Cunningham in 1994.\r\n\r\n**Massive Wiki** turns the usual centralized wiki system inside-out, using simple text files shared by the wiki participants, located on their personal devices. Revisions are tracked automatically, allowing participants to review past versions. Optionally, each wiki can be published to the web as HTML files.\r\n\r\nMassive Wiki is a collection of open source practices and tools that helps you:\r\n\r\n- build a wiki for one person (a personal wiki, knowledge garden, or PKM)\r\n- build a collaborative wiki for multiple people\r\n- publish your wiki to a website\r\n\r\nRead more to [[Get Started with Massive Wiki]].\r\n\r\nWe also have a [[Massive Wiki Conceptual Diagram]] which helps to illustrate how it works.\r\n"},{"link":"/Frequently_Asked_Questions_about_Massive_Wiki.html","title":"/Frequently_Asked_Questions_about_Massive_Wiki.html","body":"# Frequently Asked Questions about Massive Wiki\r\n\r\nQ: Who's behind Massive Wiki?\r\n\r\nA: Peter Kaminski got it started in 2021. Pete co-founded Socialtext, an enterprise wiki company, in 2002.  Bill Anderson and others have been of immeasurable help in getting Massive Wiki going.\r\n\r\nQ: What's the business model of Massive Wiki?\r\n\r\nA: Massive Wiki doesn't have a business model, it's an open source project we work on in the hope that it will be useful and help make the world a better place.  Some day, some of us might offer training or consulting services, or develop compatible software that makes sense to charge for, but Massive Wiki is intended to always be an open, community-oriented project, not something we want to monetize.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there one big \"Massive Wiki\", or are there more than one?\r\n\r\nA: The word \"massive\" comes from an earlier acronym we used (see [[What Massive Wiki Means]]). It doesn't mean that there's one very large wiki. It doesn't even mean that an individual \"Massive Wiki\" is that big. :-)\r\n\r\nQ: Can you edit Massive Wikis on the web?\r\n\r\nA: Classic wikis were edited on the central wiki server, through the web.  Massive Wiki is typically edited on each participants' personal devices, then published to the wiki website, where it is not editable.  Having said that, some wikis can be edited through the web interface of the Git forge where they're hosted, if you have the right editing privileges.  We do hope someday to create editing interfaces that will work directly on the wiki website pages."},{"link":"/404.html","title":"/404.html","body":"<!-- This page is a special page for the website version.

We use Git to manage history and distribution of the files. Currently we're using GitHub to serve as the centralized repository for the wikis, but it could be another server instead, or completely decentralized.\r\n\r\nA good way to read and edit the whole wiki is to clone the GitHub repo for the wiki, and then use the Obsidian app to open that directory as a vault.\r\n\r\nSee more instructions at [[Get Started with Massive Wiki]].\r\n\r\n![[massive-wiki-conceptual-diagram-20210425.png]]\r\n\r\n_This diagram can be edited with [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). Just download the PNG file and load in the diagrams.net editor._\r\n"},{"link":"/Get_Started_with_Massive_Wiki.html","title":"/Get_Started_with_Massive_Wiki.html","body":"# Get Started with Massive Wiki\r\n\r\nThis is an overview of how you and Massive Wiki work together.\r\n\r\nIf the concepts we cover below are familiar to you, you're good to go!\r\n\r\nIf some of concepts are new, it may take a little while to familiarize yourself with everything. It might help to find a tech-oriented friend to help you. Or email us at [help@massive.wiki](mailto:help@massive.wiki), and one of our volunteers will be in touch.\r\n\r\n## Create and Edit Text Files\r\n\r\n1. Create and edit simple text files in a folder on a computer. Each file will be a page in the wiki.\r\n2. Use Markdown for simple formatting, as desired.\r\n\r\nYou can use standard text editors like Notepad or Text Edit, and standard file managers like Windows Explorer or Finder.\r\n\r\nYou can also use similar but enhanced third-party tools that work with standard text files and folders.\r\n\r\nThere are some editors that have built in support for Markdown. Those are good, too.  But read on about links in the next section, you may want one of the tools there instead...\r\n\r\n## Give Pages Titles and Make Links\r\n\r\n1. Give each page a title. As the first line of text in the file, type `#`, then a space, then the title, like this: `# My Example Page`.\r\n2. On any pages, add links to other pages. Create a link by enclosing a word or phrase in double square brackets, like this: `[[My Example Page]]`.\r\n\r\nJust by using these two conventions, you've got yourself a wiki, with pages and links.  You could now, for example, print out all the pages, and then as you were reading a page and got to a link, you could shuffle through all the pages in your printout to find the page with the right title on top, and then read that destination page.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, though, that's not as easy as the web, where you can just read a page, click on a link, and then the new page pops right up.\r\n\r\nTo make entering and following links easier on your computer, you might want to use a special editor that knows how to handle links in Markdown.  One very good choice is Obsidian.  Another good choice is Pulsar Editor.\r\n\r\n## Sync and Share Files\r\n\r\n1. If you just want a personal wiki, you might want to have a way to synchronize the page files between your devices, and maybe to a cloud service as a backup.\r\n2. If you want to work with other people, you need a way to synchronize the page files between multiple people and their devices.\r\n3. When working with multiple people, or even if you're just by yourself, it helps to keep previous versions of each file, in case you want to refer back to a previous version.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to accomplish these goals, each with pros and cons.  For Massive Wiki, we've tried a few different ways, and we'd like to recommend a tool from the world of software development, a sharing and version management system called Git.\r\n\r\nGit is a little difficult to understand, and a little complicated to use. The power, reliability, and standardization it provides make it worth putting up with.\r\n\r\nPeople are working on tools that help explain the complexity and encapsulate the difficulty. You'll find some resources here: [[Working with Git]].\r\n\r\nWhen you use Git to share and version Markdown wiki files, you'll have completed the \"Massive Wiki checklist\":\r\n\r\n- [x] Markdown \r\n- [x] Shared\r\n- [x] Versioned\r\n- [x] Files\r\n- [x] Titles and Links\r\n\r\nSee [[What Massive Wiki Means]] for more background on the items in this checklist.\r\n\r\n## Publishing to the Web\r\n\r\nDo you want to share the pages in your wiki with your non-wiki friends, or with the world?\r\n\r\nAn open source publishing system called Massive Wiki Builder, used in conjunction with Massive Wiki Themes and Massive Wiki Starter (a special empty wiki), makes it easy to have your wiki turned into a website hosted on the web, every time you sync to a cloud service.\r\n\r\nRead more about [[Massive Wiki Builder]] and [[Massive Wiki Starter]]."},{"link":"/Massive_Wiki_Builder.html","title":"/Massive_Wiki_Builder.html","body":"# Massive Wiki Builder\r\n\r\nYou can use many applications to view and edit Massive Wikis.\r\n\r\nOne helpful tool, Massive Wiki Builder, converts a Massive Wiki into a static HTML website, for easy viewing on the web.

The word \"Wiki\" represents naming and easy linking between pages, as well as the \"wiki culture\" of collaborative writing.\r\n\r\nMaSVF stands for **Ma** rkdown, **S** hared, **V** ersioned, **F** iles.\r\n\r\n## Markdown\r\n\r\nWe use **Markdown** because it is a lingua franca.  It's simple to learn and use, and \"good enough\" for many, if not all, formatting needs.\r\n\r\n## Shared\r\n\r\nWiki is best when it's **shared** with others.  Sharing files lets them move around, from centralized servers to decentralized servers, and from peer to peer.\r\n\r\n## Versioned\r\n\r\nWhen page contention happens, **version** history is important to be able to do whatever manual merge is necessary.\r\n\r\nVersion history is also very handy if you want to refer back to a previous version of a page.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\nEach page is one **file.**\r\n\r\nStandard files are an easy and reasonably precise unit of data interchange between different computer systems.\r\n\r\nThe plural \"files\" is important -- a wiki needs more than one page.\r\n\r\n## Wiki\r\n\r\nUsing easy **linking** and **named pages,** **Wiki** is one of the best ways to organize and share text-based information and knowledge.

However, it comes with some \"sharp edges\". People in the Massive Wiki community and the Git community at large have spent a lot of time to try to make it easier, but it's still sometimes a little prickly to work with. It's continuing to get better. In the meantime, thank you for your patience and forgiveness. :-)\r\n\r\nIf you run into problems, email us at [help@massive.wiki](mailto:help@massive.wiki), and one of our volunteers will be in touch.\r\n\r\n## Installing Git\r\n\r\nOn Windows or Mac, installing Obsidian and then the Obsidian Git plugin is a good first step.  On Windows, also install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (64-bit).  Starting to use the Obsidian Git plugin will usually start the rest of the install process on Windows and Mac.\r\n\r\nLinux computers usually have Git pre-installed.\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Git Forge Authentication\r\n\r\nIf you are using a Git forge such as GitHub or Codeberg as part of your Massive Wiki workflow (either by yourself or with others), you'll need to set up Git with your authentication credentials. We'll write more about authentication later.\r\n\r\n## Using Git\r\n\r\nIn Obsidian or Pulsar Editor, there is a Git panel you can enable, which allows for push-button control of Git. In Obsidian, use the Command Palette to find \"Obsidian Git: Open Source Control View\" to activate the panel.\r\n\r\nIn brief, here are the workflow steps when syncing changes up and down.  There are a lot of finer details to cover, we'll continue to improve our documentation.\r\n\r\n### In A Repo Where You're A Member\r\n\r\n-   pull new changes from the cloud\r\n-   edit files locally\r\n-   add/remove files to/from \"Staged\"\r\n-   when ready, commit, with a commit message\r\n-   pull again, to make sure any upstream changes get merged\r\n-   push your changes to the cloud\r\n\r\n### With A Repo Where You're Not A Member\r\n\r\n-   fork repo into your own Git forge account\r\n-   make changes as above\r\n-   create a \"pull request\" (GitHub name) / \"merge request\" (GitLab name) and submit it to the original repo maintainers\r\n\r\n## More Git Background\r\n\r\nGit is the leading \"version control\" or \"revision control\" solution for tracking and managing changes in sets of text files.  It is open source, and was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds.\r\n\r\nIt has been built by, and primarily used by, software developers who use it to help manage the source code changes in large and small software projects.  As such, it has always been powerful, but not necessarily easy to use.\r\n\r\nGit comprises the software and protocol used to track changes between computers. A related tool is the \"Git forge\", which is a centralized cloud website that coordinates the use of Git between multiple people.  The original Git forge is GitHub, which was started in 2008.  GitHub supports many open and closed source projects for free, but they also require paid subscription for advanced uses.  GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.\r\n\r\nOther Git forges include GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, and Sourcehut.  There is also software for self-hosting a forge, including Gitea, Forgejo, and Gitolite."},{"link":"/.obsidian/README.html","title":"/.obsidian/README.html","body":"This is a placeholder file to ensure that its containing directory is created.\r\n\r\nThis directory is normally used by the [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/) on an individual's computer.
